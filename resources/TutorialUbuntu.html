<h1>Ubuntu operating system</h1>

<p>Computational archaeology does not need to break the bank. In fact, the most computationally sophisticated archaeology can be done on a shoestring budget. At the core of high-powered, low-cost computing are an inexpensive computer and free <i>operating system</i>.</p> 

<p>All computers have an operating system (OS) that organizes files and programs. There are three common OSs on the market&ndash;Windows, Mac, and Linux. Windows and Mac are the most widely used and best known. However, they are not necessarily the best nor are they necessarily the easiest to use. Linux operating systems are more accessible&ndash;they tend to be open-source and free&ndash;and they are tend to be the most powerful operating systems preferred by computational specialists. A challenge to using Linux OSs is that they can be intimidating because they are not always intuitive and may require some specialized computer knowledge to operate. That said, there are flavors of Linux OSs that are quite user friendly and have a large support community. This tutorial introduces a Linux operating systems called <a href="https://ubuntu.com/download/desktop" target="_blank">Ubuntu Desktop</a>. Here you will learn how install and us Ubuntu Desktop&ndash;a free, open-source, user-friendly, and extremely powerful operating system for your computer.</p>

<p>Specifically, here are some of the computational tools that Ubuntu OS will give you access to for free: a graphical user interface (GUI) for managing your files, R statistical computing language for basic calculations to the most sophisticated mathematical modeling, a pdf viewer for reading articles and other documents, LibreOffice Suite for drafting manuscripts, spreadsheets, and presentations; QGIS for geographic database management and analysis; ...</p>

<p>Before you invest time and effort into Ubuntu, there are some important considerations. Parallel OS? Erase other OS? Software needs?</p>

<h2>Materials</h2>
<ol>
  <li>Computer. It is often possible to get a powerful used computer at low cost.</li>
  <ul>
    <li>2 GHz dual-core processor or better</li>
    <li>4 GB system memory</li>
    <li>25 GB of free hard drive space</li>
    <li>A USB port for the installer media</li>
  </ul>
  <li>Internet access</li>
  <li>A flash drive with at least 5 GB of space</li>

<h2>Installation</h2>
<ol>
  <li>Create Installation disk</li>
  <ol>
    <li>On a computer with Internet conection, navigative to <a href="https://ubuntu.com/download/desktop" target="_blank">the Ubuntu Desktop download</a>site.</li>
    <li>Download the Desktop installation (iso) file.</li> 
    <li>Insert your flash drive.</li>
    <li>If using an Ubuntu OS already, open the Make Startup Disk application</li>
    <li>For the source disc image, find the iso file you just downloaded.</li>
    <li>For the Disk to use, find the flash drive that you plugged in.</li>
    <li>click, Make Startup Disk.</li>
    <li>When the startup disk is created, remove it.</li>
  </ol>
  <li>Insert the startup disk into the computer onto which you want to install Ubuntu.?li>
